            I have over 4 years of experience as a cloud support engineer (AWS / Terramark), and have worked
            at both medium and large organizations. While I'm a proficient linux system and network administrator, 
            my expertise is in supporting scalable backend AWS compute services (EC2, ECS)
        </p>
        <p>
           I love helping folks.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a midlevel individual contributor role where I can take team based support responsibilites,
           and gain deeper experience with large scale architecture and automation.
